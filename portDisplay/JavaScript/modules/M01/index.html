  I am currently attending Ivy Tech Community College to achieve my Associate of Applied Science in Software Development! I am currently 28 years old.
  I have 4 amazing children, 2 boys and 2 girls. Their names are Bailey, Bristol, Emmett, and Memphis. My dream is to start my own programming business and to create
  new and exciting applications and websites for the community!

  Growing up I bounced back and forth between my mom and dad's house. We always had the latest technology in both houses and computers have fascinated me since as far back
  as I can remember! Going through middle and high school I was the guy everyone came to with help on their PC's. Even though I didn't know that much back then, I always
  loved to help everyone out and "tinker" with computers. As I progressed into my junior year I went to Vantage Career Center for Network Systems and I wasn't very thrilled
  for most of the class. I absolutely hated the hardware side of computers but I just couldn't get enough of VB.NET, Python, and little Cobol! Today, I'm still extremely
  fascinated with computers and when I'm not asleep, at work, or playing with my kids I can usually be found in my office inside my house! I have plans for the shed to expand it
  and add a little office onto the side of it for a server room or workstation.
