  <p>If you use <code>var</code> the variable is declared within the scope you are in (e.g. of the function).
    If you don't use <code>var</code>, the variable bubbles up through the layers of scope until it encounters a variable by the given name or the global object, where it then attaches.
    It is then very similar to a global variable.</p>
  <p>Assigning to a variable without using <code>var</code> does not make it global. It causes JavaScript to traverse up the scope chain, eventually ending up at the global object
    if the variable was not used anywhere before. If the variable was declared using <code>var</code> somewhere before global, that's the scope that will be used.
    It's also an integral part of how JavaScript works and what makes it really powerful. </p>
<p>In the global scope then there's no difference with or without var. In a function then <code>var</code> will create a local variable, no <code>var</code> will look up the scope chain
  (bubble up the DOM) until it finds the variable or hits the global scope (at which point it will create it).</p>
