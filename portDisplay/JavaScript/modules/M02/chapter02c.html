<h1>Operators</h1>
<p>JavaScript operators are binary or unary. A binary operator requires an operand before and after the operator.
  The equal sign in the statement myNumber = 100; is an example of a binary operator. A unary operator requires just a single operand either before or after the operator.</p>

<h2>Arithmetic Operators</h2>
<div><code>x = 21</code></div>
<div><code>y = 7</code></div>
<ul class="operators">
  <script>
    var x = 21;
    var y = 7;
    var sum = x + y;
    var difference = x - y;
    var mult = x * y;
    var quotient = x / y;
    var remainder = x % y;
    x++;
    y--;
    var nextX = x;
    var prevY = y;

    document.write("\n<li> x + y = " + sum + "</li>\n");
    document.write("\n<li> x - y = " + difference + "</li>\n");
    document.write("\n<li> x * y = " + mult + "</li>\n");
    document.write("\n<li> x / y = " + quotient + "</li>\n");
    document.write("\n<li> x % y = " + remainder + "</li>\n");
    document.write("\n<li> x++ = " + nextX + "</li>\n");
    document.write("\n<li> y-- = " + prevY + "</li>\n");
  </script>
</ul>

<h2>Assignment Operators</h2>
<p>An assignment operator is used for assigning a value to a variable. You have already used the most common assignment operator, the equal sign (=),
  to assign values to variables you declared using the <code>var</code> statement. The equal sign assigns an initial value to a new variable or assigns a new value to an existing variable.
  JavaScript includes other assignment operators in addition to the equal sign. Each of these additional assignment operators, called compound assignment operators, performs mathematical
  calculations on variables and literal values in an expression, and then assigns a new value to the left operand.</p>
<div><code>x = 5</code></div>
<div><code>y = 4</code></div>
<div><code>string1 = "Hello "</code></div>
<div><code>string2 = "World"</code></div>
<ul class="operators">
  <script>
    var x = 5;
    var y = 4;
    x += y; // x is now 9
    string1 = "Hello ";
    string2 = "World";
    string1 += string2; // string1 is now "Hello World"
    document.write("\n<li>x += y stores " + x + " in the variable x </li>\n");
    document.write("\n<li> string1 += string2 stores " + string1 + " in the variable string1</li>\n");
  </script>
</ul>

<h2>Comparison Operators</h2>
<p>A comparison operator, or relational operator, is used to compare two operands and determine if one value is greater than another, etc. A Boolean value of true or false is returned after two operands are compared.</p>
<div><code>x = 5</code></div><!-- change this to 3 after running as 5 -->
<div><code>y = 4</code></div>
<ul class="operators">
  <script>
    var x = 3; // change this to 3 after running as 5
    var y = 4;
    x > y ? result = "condition is true" : result = "condition is false";
    document.write("\n<li> Testing the condition <strong>x > y</strong></li>\n");
    document.write("<li>returns the result \"" + result + "\"</li>\n");
    // Change the value of x in both the DIV and the VAR above from 5 to 3 and run again
  </script>
</ul>
</article>

<h2>Logical Operators</h2>
<p>Logical operators are used to modify Boolean values or specify the relationship between operands in an expression that results in a Boolean value.
  For example, a script for an automobile insurance company may need to determine whether a customer is male and under 25 in order to determine the correct insurance quote.
  As with comparison operators, a Boolean value of true or false is returned after two operands are evaluated.</p>

<ul class="operators">
  <script>
    var gender = "M" // Change this to "F" after running as "M"
    var age = 21; // Try different values after running as 21
    var highPremium = gender === "M" && age < 25;
    document.write("\n<li> Testing the condition " + gender + " && " + age + "</li>\n");
    document.write("<li>returns highPremium = \"" + highPremium + "\"</li>\n");
  </script>
</ul>
